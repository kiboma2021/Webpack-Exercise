# Webpack-Exercise

Webpack is used to compile JavaScript modules.

There are problems with managing JavaScript projects this way:

- It is not immediately apparent that the script depends on an external library.
- If a dependency is missing, or included in the wrong order, the application will not    function properly.
- If a dependency is included but not used, the browser will be forced to download unnecessary code.

Webpack is used to manage these scripts instead.
